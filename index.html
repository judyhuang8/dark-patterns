  <h1>Dark Patterns</h1>

  <p>
    Dark Patterns is a term coined by Harry Brignull, to describe
    the various ways businesses trick users into doing something that they didn't
    mean to do (ie. creating a subscription). In some cases, these tricks also
    hinder users from doing what they want to do (ie. cancelling a subscription).
    These tricks are mainly applied through websites or apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website explores the various types of dark patterns that businesses
    use as well as provide examples so that users can be well informed.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Dark Patterns</h2>
  <p>
    Below are some examples of dark patterns.
    There are many other examples and types of dark patterns that can be viewed <a
      href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-patterns">here.</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Roach Motel</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Have you ever tried deleting your Amazon account? Prior to 2020, to close
      your Amazon account you had to navigate through many links on the website
      in order to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kxkrdLI6e6M?t=20">Here is a video</a>
      that illustrates how challenging it was to delete your Amazon account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating an account, in comparison is much simplier. By entering your name,
      email, and setting a password, you can create an Amazon account. This design
      in which it is easy to enter the business (ie. creating an account), but hard to get
      out of (ie. cancelling a subscription) is what is known as a Roach Motel.

  <h3>Misdirection</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Misdirection is when the design of something (ie. buttons) is done to purposefully
        get your attention on one things, in order to distract you from another. One
        classic example is the color of a button. Designers make the color of the button
        they want you to click on a bold or bright color, while leaving the other option
        a more netural background color.
      </p>

      <p>
        This example of misdirection by Instagram tricks users into allowing Instagram
        to gain access of more of their person information. By making the button a
        bright blue color, it makes users more likely to select it.

  <h3>Tricky Questions</h3>
  <p>
    By using confusing language, like double negatives, it creates confusion in
    the users and thereby tricking them into signing up for something they didn't
    mean to sign up for. This is most commonly seen in the checkboxes for email
    subscriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    An exmaple of a tricky question is shown below:
  </p>

  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="no-spam" name="no-spam">
    <label for="no-spam">Please do not send me promotional emails and offers</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="also-no-spam" name="also-no-spam">
    <label for="also-no-spam">Please do not uncheck if you wish to not receive promotional
      emails and offers.
    </label>
  </div>

  <h3>Confirmshaming</h3>
  <p>
    Similar to tricky questions, confirmshaming is phrasing of decline options that
    are in a way to shame the user into compliance. It is the act of guilting the
    user into something that they did not want. The most common form of confirmshaming
    is when sites ask you to sign up for newletters or promotions.
  </p>
  <img src='imgs/confirmshaming.png'>
  <p>
    By using phrases like "No thanks, I'm not into savings" or "No, I'd like to pay full price",
    business trick users into feeling guilty about clicking the no option.

  </p>

  <h3>Bait and Switch</h3>
  <p>
    Bait and switch is when the user wants to do one thing, but a different, undesired
    thing actually occurs. One of the most famous example of a bait and switch was
    Microsoft's approach to having users upgrade their computers to Windows 10. In
    the photo below, this pop up was shown when Microsoft prompted it's users to
    switch. Most people who did not want to upgrade would click the "x" in the
    top right corner. Users might have assumed that they closed the pop up and have decided
    to not upgrade to Windows 10. However, in this specifc instance, closing the pop up
    by clicking the "x" actually meant "Yes, I do want to upgrade my computer to Windows 10."

  <h2>Dark Patterns in the News</h2>
  <!-- <p>
    As dark patterns are more widely used across the internet, there needs to be a 
    way to regulate these patterns so that consumers are not tricked into doing something 
    they did not desire. California has set regulations for businesses that ban forms 
    of dark patterns. The FTC
  </p> -->
  <h3>California Bans Dark Patterns</h3>
  <p>
    Recently California has passed a
    <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/CCPA%20March%2015%20Regs.pdf">regulation</a>
    banning the use of dark patterns. This comes as an enforcement to the
    California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) passed in 2018. The CCPA gives
    Californians the right to say no to the sale of personal information. However,
    many state officials are worried that these options to say no will be difficult
    to navigate to, like Roach Motels. Therefore, by banning dark patterns, it
    allows California to ensure that their consumers are not "confused or misled
    when seeking to exercise their privacy rights."
  </p>
  <p>
    The regulation does not ban
    all forms of dark patterns, only those that have "the substantial effect of
    subverting or impairing a consumer's choice to opt-out" of having their personal
    information sold.
    Tricky questions is an example of a dark pattern that would be banned as the
    regulations state that opt-out notices shall "use straightforward language
    and avoid technical or legal jargon". Businesses that are found to not be in
    compliance with the regulations are sent a "notice to cure" in which they are
    given 30 days to change their services accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Banning the use of dark patterns is gaining traction from both parties. In
    2019, Senators Mark Warner(D-VA) and Deb Fischer(R-NE)
    <a
      href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-senators-new-bill-would-ban-online-dark-patterns-that-trick-consumers-2019-4">
      introduced a bill</a> banning tech
    firms from suing dark patterns. Rohit Chopra, the commissioner of the Federal
    Trade Commission (FTC) has spoken out against dark patterns as well. Moreover,
    recently the FTC <a
      href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/bringing-dark-patterns-light-ftc-workshop">held a virtual
      workshop</a> examining dark patterns and their regulations.
  </p>

  <h3>Dark Pattern's Affect on Communities of Color</h3>
  <p>
    In the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/bringing-dark-patterns-light-ftc-workshop">recent
      FTC workshop</a> on dark patterns, Mutale Nkonde, CEO of AI for the People,
    discusses the impact that dark patterns have on communities of color. The specific
    business she brought to light is Intuit's TurboTax. Turbotax is a software that consumers
    can use to file taxes, it is what helps bring Intuit profit. However, the IRS has
    stated that Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies must provide a free online
    filing system for Americans that earn below $66,000 a year. Therefore, Intuit launched
    their free edition of TurboTax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite promising consumers who were low income
    free filing of their taxes and having the word "free" 5 times on their website,
    it was not actually the case. As Nkonde explains, someone who is a TaskRabbit cleaner
    and earns $29,000 annually needs to click through Intuit's "free" filing services
    5 times before being told that they actually do not qualify for free filing
    because they are an independent contractor. This branding of Intuit's free edition
    of TurboTax is considered a dark pattern because it lets the user believe that they
    are getting a free service as the company claims when it is not the case.
  </p>
  <p>
    This affects communities of color as the median houseshold income of Black
    Americans is $41,000, Latinx Americans is $51,000, and Native Americans is $48,000.
    Large percentages of these communities qualify for free filing of their taxes, but
    cannot actually file them for free, despite these "free" branded comapnies. Therefore,
    as Nkonde says, income becomes a proxy for race.
