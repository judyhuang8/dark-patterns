  <h1>Dark Patterns</h1>

  <p>
    Dark Patterns is a term coined by Harry Brignull, to describe
    the various ways businesses trick users into doing something that they didn't
    mean to do (ie. creating a subscription). In some cases, these tricks also
    hinder users from doing what they want to do (ie. cancelling a subscription).
    These tricks are mainly applied through websites or apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website explores the various types of dark patterns that businesses
    use as well as provide examples so that users can be well informed.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Dark Patterns</h2>
  <h3>Roach Motel</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Have you ever tried deleting your Amazon account? Prior to 2020, to close
      your Amazon account you had to navigate through many links on the website
      in order to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kxkrdLI6e6M?t=20">Here is a video</a>
      that illustrates how challenging it was to delete your Amazon account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating an account, in comparison is much simplier. By entering your name,
      email, and setting a password, you can create an Amazon account. This design
      in which it is easy to enter the business (ie. creating an account), but hard to get
      out of (ie. cancelling a subscription) is what is known as a Roach Motel.

  <h3>Misdirection</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Misdirection is when the design of something (ie. buttons) is done to purposefully
        get your attention on one things, in order to distract you from another. One
        classic example is the color of a button. Designers make the color of the button
        they want you to click on a bold or bright color, while leaving the other option
        a more netural background color.
      </p>

      <p>
        This example of misdirection by Instagram tricks users into allowing Instagram
        to gain access of more of their person information. By making the button a
        bright blue color, it makes users more likely to select it.

  <h3>Tricky Questions</h3>
  <p>
    By using confusing language, like double negatives, it creates confusion in
    the users and thereby tricking them into signing up for something they didn't
    mean to sign up for. This is most commonly seen in the checkboxes for email
    subscriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    An exmaple of a tricky question is shown below:
  </p>

  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="no-spam" name="no-spam">
    <label for="no-spam">Please do not send me promotional emails and offers</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input type="checkbox" id="also-no-spam" name="also-no-spam">
    <label for="also-no-spam">Please do not uncheck if you wish to not receive promotional
      emails and offers.
    </label>
  </div>
